# AdHocNetworks
Code for maintaining one and two-hop neighborhood information for ad hoc networks with strict storage requirements for use in broadcast and unicast algorithms.
Implementation of Scalable Broadcast Algorithm (SBA) as proposed by Peng and Lu (2000). PDF of original paper provided
Due to lack of access to arduinos testing of SBA code is currently limited. One and two hop neighborhoods are fully tested.
